# DAY 047

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

Codeworks has been a pretty big struggle for me. Balancing family life and having the added financial stress has been difficult. I feel that looking back or "reflecting" on these last 3 months I am most definitely proud of my accomplishments but its still not over! I am working my way through this final project and then on to even bigger and better things? Hopefully. 
I'm not sure how to manage my time, I'm not great at doing that but as far as managing time on this final project I'll just keep doing what I have been doing; which is taking frequent breaks and then just setting a goal for the next hour. So on and so forth. 
I would say that the thing I've enjoyed the most from this experience is the people I have met. Everyone at codeworks is pretty great. Its refreshing being around so many people that are striving for something better. I haven't had that kind of positive energy in a long while.
