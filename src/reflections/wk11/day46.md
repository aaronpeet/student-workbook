## What is SQL injection?

It is used by attackers to insert arbitrary code into our database and attack our web applications.

## What are 3 methods SQL injection can be done by?

injecting code through: User input forms on the website. Modifing cookies to store client state information locally. And by injecting sql straight into the HTTP headers.

## How can we detect and sanitize SQL injection attacks?

A firewall can prevent basic SQL injection attacks. IDSes can monitor all connections to the database. These are all good measures but the best way to prevent is to just sanitize your code.
