## What is the purpose of wire-framing?

the purpose is to have a rough outline of what you and the stakeholders want your website to look like before you wriet any code.

## What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

low-fidelity wire frames are literally pen on paper drawings without specific color or text. this will be your first draft.

mid-fidelity wire frames have a little more detail and can be considered a second draft. this will probably use lorem ipsums to show were content will be placed on the page and can also have some color differences to show the hierarchy of your page lay-out such as different shades of grey; darkest being the most important and lightest being least important.

high-fidelity wire frames will show us photos, colors schemes and example text with accurate pixel spacing. Although this form is still not technically functional it will show us a none interactive form of our future website.

## Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

They are essential to give the developer a jumping off point when creating a website that will be user friendly. Not only will it save you time in the long run but the article mentions that it can also save you money by making adjustments that the stakeholders have requested earlier on in the design process. 
    I also think that it is a natural step in the building process. I have been making hand drawn wireframes all week without even knowing what it was called.
