## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

My favorite tips from the reading; I like how it showed that you could use color shades to indicate importance on your page rather than font size. I had also never really thought about the importance of hierarchy, but it makes sense as far as where you want to draw attention to your page. I also like the idea of using space instead of borders to grid your website, or even just a shadow box looks a lot more clean.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I honestly think that I will be referencing this reading assingment a lot just for some quick tips as a reminder to keep it simple.

## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

its like the zupas website we looked at today in class. when a website is well designed and clean AND functional it makes for a better experience as a user. Design kind of sets the tone and conveys whatever type of representation the client is expecting. if its to bold or too subtle it can be the difference between a website that users will return to or not.
