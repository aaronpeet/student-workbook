## In your own words, why do we use Git?

git is used when multiple developers are coding on the same project. Git helps to organize, merge and later share the code from individual "local repositories" all in to a single "remote repository"

## What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

multiple branches is what allows individual developers to be able to work on different parts of the same project and be able to merge and share sections of code.

## What is the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is used to allow multiple developers on seperate branches to work on the same project, Github is used to allow each developer to access to others branches.
