##What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?

a pseudo-class is something that you can add to a specific element in your css that not only adds specificity but also adds additional function to your website. the examples given were :before, :after and :hover. ":hover" is the only one i am familiar with and i can see myself using it a lot while styling a website.

##What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

specificity defines how important a css rule is and can override the order of operations in some cases. this can allow you to target specific sections of code without disrupting others.

##What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

the !important feature overrides all css rules and has as much specificity as inline styling, this can be helpful but can also cause a lot of issues if you need to go back and debug or make changes to your code.
