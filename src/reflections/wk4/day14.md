# DAY 014

## What are the three states of a Promise?

Pending, completed and failed.

## How do promises seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

Instead of having a long pyrimid list of callbacks we can chain our call back together using promises.

## What is the difference between .then() and .catch()?

.then() is the action that follows after a promise has been kept successfully, the .catch() is used when that promise has failed.
