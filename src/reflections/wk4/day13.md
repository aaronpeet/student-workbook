## What are some of the signs and causes of Callback Hell?

Basically if youre writing your code from top to bottom, exactly how you imagine that code to run it could end up looking bulkier and messier than it needs to be. One of the main causes of this is a new guy like me, not knowing what I am doing.

## What does the asynchronous mean and how are callbacks involved?

asynchronous code means that you can ask your code to jump ahead if it is waiting on load time for any specific part of your website. meaning that all other functions should still be usable and accessable even though another part of your code is still waiting for some data feedback.

## Summarize the 3 ways to avoid / fix Callback Hell.

1. keep your code shallow
2. modularize
3. handle every single error
