# DAY 038

## How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?

Scrum with a large team might be broke up into even smaller increments or features. And also with a larger team you might have a team that is strictly backend and a team that is strictly front end.

## Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.

That way the entire team is on the same page. We ran into the issue of assuming that after two and a half days of planning we had it all figured out. But we needed to have at least two more overhaul meetings during our project to get everyone back on the same page.

## What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?

It means that you have a quality product, delivered in a reasonable amount of time at a good price. Basically in scrum this means Minimum Viable Product or MVP. What can we delivery after the first sprint? what can we deliver after our second sprint? And how many more sprints will we reasonably need to complete this project?
