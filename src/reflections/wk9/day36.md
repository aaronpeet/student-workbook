# DAY 036

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We are using Vue.js in the front end and Node.js in the backend. We are trying to run our project using the scrum method, to organize and set goals for each day.

## What went well so far?

I think overall we have picked a good team, and although we wont always be able to choose the team we are working on, in this case it has been very helpful. We have also tried really hard to make sure that everyone has worked on every aspect of our project which for me personally has helped alot because I definitely feel more comfortable working on backend features but I was able to put myself in situations that were more difficult on the client side.

## What would you do differently? Why?

I would not be the product owner. I tried my best but ultimately leadership is not a strong quality that I posess. I'm more of a second in command kind of guy.
