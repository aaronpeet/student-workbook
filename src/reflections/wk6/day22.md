## What are props?

props are a pathway to pull functionality or values from parent components

## What are props used for?

they are used to add functionality if it needed, or to more easily access data pulled from the api. If the work has already been done in a parent component we might as well use props to access that data or functionality to be reused in other areas of our code.

## Where can props be used or accessed?

Props can only be passed down from parent components to children components and can be reused in any child component.
