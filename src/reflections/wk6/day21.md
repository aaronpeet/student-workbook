## What is Component based architecture?

Component based architecture allows you to seperate different parts of your user interface so that they exist seperately and can be interacted with seperately on the UI.

## What are some benefits of Component based architecture?

It allows the user to make changes on the DOM, and only update specific elements without rendering the entire page all over again. Example would be having multiple chats at one time on facebook, they all look the same but are seperately rendering information to the page.

## What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?

It can become bloated and unreadable if overused.
