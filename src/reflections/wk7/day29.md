## What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?

Its basically notes to your future self or coworkers about how your code works. You can make a how-to-use document, a README file in your repository or write Docs directly in the source.

## What are some benefits of Code Documentation?

It allows you to come back to old code and understand how specific pieces fit into the grander scheme of your overall project, and it takes out any misinterpretations of your code.

## How important is Code documentation and why?

For that very reason that I stated above. If there are no documents to read later and remember why you did what you did you will easily forget the logic that made so much sense to you at the time you wrote you code.
