# DAY 031

## Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

We did try to adhere to the basic design principles, but we definitly needed a better plan on our layout and page flow.

## What went well?

My partner and I took the time to really try and understand the back end of our website. Without the postman tests its hard to know if we actually understood how that should look, but we were both interested and engaged in the learning process and that made it fun, for a few days.

## What would you do differently?

We felt like we ran out of time by the end of the day wednesday. we didn't keep ourselves on a schedule, we didn't set goals for what we should have accomplished at the end of each day. Because of this we decided to make a new branch of the project so that we could both write code in different areas of the project. We had a lot of issues because we are unfamiliar with this process. Alot of our stuff would break when we merged and that was a big setback for us.
