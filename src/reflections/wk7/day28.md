## What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?

Pair programming or partner programming is just that, when you team up with someone to write code. One person drives (types) and the other person navigates (gives directions and points out corrections to be made).

## What are some benefits of Pair Programming?

The things that I find beneficial are that one; you have someone to talk through your difficult parts or the logic behind a difficult piece of code and two; you have someone to point any quick fixes if there are syntax errors.

## What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?

Drawbacks are the same in any partnership, if someone is driving and navigating leaving the other person little to do. If there are any disputes to the layout or logic that can make it difficult.
