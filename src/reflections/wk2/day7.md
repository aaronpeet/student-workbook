## What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style?

-Evaluate conditonal statements

-Read printed messages or errors
     this will help you to know which line of your code is sending back the error.

-View data from your JavaScript files
    as you write function you can console.log them into your console tab which allows you to know whether or not you javascript files are actually linked or in effect in your code.

-Test functions
    you can actually invoke your functions within the console tab and send data through it to check that its working properly.

## Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

the elements tab is where you can access all of your html and css files and can make changes that affect the immediate page. it can help you trouble shoot any bugs by making changes and seeing quickly how it affects your page. these changes are not saved, so no harm no foul if you need to solve this bug through trial and error.

## Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

a better way to debug your code would be using the "sources tab", using this dev tool allows us to add break points in our code to determine where our bug might be occuring. it also allows us to move through our code one line at a time which can also help us pin point which piece of code is causing an error or bug.
