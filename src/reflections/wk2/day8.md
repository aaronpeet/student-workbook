## What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

it gives you a chance to write out logically how to create your web page or solve your problem before ever writting the code out. I have found that talking outloud with a partner is very helpful for problem solving. 

## How do you find answers when you are stuck?

sometimes through trial and error, mostly through trial and error actually. I do a lot of googling, but it is only sometimes helpful. And I look back a lot at other projects i have created or projects that we have worked on together as a class. 
## From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

that i figgin suck at coding. haha no, my biggest take away is that there are a lot of things to learn about proper coding and that I will most likely NEVER be finished learning. And as long as I dont get stuck in a certain way of doing things, as long as I am constantly trying to learn a new tool or a better way and keep an open mind eventually I will be a somewhat awesome developer.
