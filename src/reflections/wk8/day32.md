## What function does a developer Portfolio provide?

it allows potential employers to see the types of projects you have been involved in and what kinds of skills you might have.

## What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

if it is clean and easily accessesable.

## What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?

Possibly our capstone project and my buglog website. both will be full stack apps with fairly complicated code in them. They are both clean and well written so far.
