## What is a List in C#?

A C# list is pretty much an array from what I can understand, but I don't get why you would have the functionality of turning a "list" into an "array" if we are supposed to be just using lists now with C#.

## What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?

EXISTS, CONTAINS these could be useful when trying to do a check of true or false when filtering through a list. INSERT could be useful to add something into my list.

## How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?

I would call the FIND method to filter through my list and grab the one that matches the parameters I provided.
