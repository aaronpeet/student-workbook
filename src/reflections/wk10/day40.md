## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

value type- basically anything that holds a value, such as a nymber or integer.

reference type- arrays and strings.

pointer type- points to a reference type using example "identifier"

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

bool, byte, char, decimal, double, enum, float, int, long, sbyte, short, struct, uint, ulong and ushort. These are basically all different ways to get number values, the only one I am familiar with is bool.

## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

apparently a reference type is not stored locally but it is stored using an address that accesses a memory path to that value. A value type is store locally.
