## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

It is a set string type, with set options that have to be selected specifically otherwise it will be undefined.

## How can you modify an Enum?

I have used enums while building schemas or models. They are not easily modified on the user end but its just a matter of setting the input on the server side.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?
(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

We have possibley used them in our console game challange when we ask 'would you like to play a game?y/n'
i believe that the 'y/n' is a kind of enum where the user input has to be something very specific.
