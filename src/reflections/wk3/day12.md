# DAY 012

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

to more seamlessly sync data that is being pushed or pulled through multiple places in your code by the user.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

I don't know all three of them but the one we have been taught is the ProxyState.on method which is triggered by an event from the user and invokes the service to pull or push data to the appstate.

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

using the templates allows us to inject HTML into our main.html that has been invoked through a user driven event.
