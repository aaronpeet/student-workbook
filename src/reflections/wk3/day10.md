# DAY 010

## What is the purpose of Encapsulation?

it is used to organize hundreds of lines of code and breaks it up into different files of 'like' functionality.

## What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?

I don't fully understand exactly what a closure does. it seems more complicated but the author argues that it is better than using the underscore and a prefix. The underscore as a prefix seems to be the simplest way to make something private in your code, and it makes the most logical sense to me. Closure seems to be more code to write upfront but is more flexible later on and is also more secure.



## How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

you can create them by using an '_' (underscore) before the function name, example: _draw(), "draw" being the name of my function. this is used to prevent the user from being able to access certain functions within the DOM.
