## What problem does using exports solve?

exports allow the web developer to access certain areas of code from one file to the next. This allows us to cross over from one file to another ONLY the things that we want to cross over.

## How does export differ from export default?

export allows us to use a very specific section of code from any certain file while export default just exports the entirety of code within that scope?

## What is a benefit of using the Module System?

The module system allows you to link multiple javascript files without having to worry in which order you are linking said files within your html.
