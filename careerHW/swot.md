# strengths

## 1. I am a good team player! I learned from an early age to never let my team down. I played lots of competitive team sports and the determination I learned to be a good teammate has helped me to thrive in any workspace.

## 2. I have very good interpersonal skills. I am able to find common ground with anyone and build friendships off of that common ground. I have even found that I am able to accomplish this while working with a person that others might say is "difficult to work with".

## 3. I am a creative thinker. As long as I can remember I have always gravitated towards creating and sharing my creations; whether its writing music or making movies.
